agent = Agent(description="You help people with their health and fitness goals.")

# -*- Print a response
agent.print_response('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.', markdown=True)

# -*- Get the response as a string
response = agent.run('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.', stream=False)

# -*- Get the response as a stream
response = ""
for delta in agent.run('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.'):
