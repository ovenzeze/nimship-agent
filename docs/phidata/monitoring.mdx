title: Monitoring
description: Phidata comes with built-in monitoring and debugging.
---

You can set `monitoring=True` on any agent to log that agent's sessions or set `PHI_MONITORING=true` in your environment to log all agent sessions.

Create a file `monitoring.py` with the following code:

```python monitoring.py
from phi.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
```

<Snippet file="authenticate-with-phidata.mdx" />

### Run the agent

Run the agent and view the session on [phidata.app/sessions](https://www.phidata.app/sessions)

```shell
python monitoring.py
```

/>

## Debugging

Phidata also includes a built-in debugger that will show debug logs in the terminal. You can set `debug_mode=True` on any agent to view debug logs or set `PHI_DEBUG=true` in your environment.

```python debugging.py
from phi.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(markdown=True, debug_mode=True)
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
```

Run the agent to view debug logs in the terminal:

```shell
python debugging.py
```

<img height="200" src="/images/debugging.png" style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }} />
