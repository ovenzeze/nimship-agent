Running Agents in production is hard, we need to:

1. Serve them using an application like **FastApi**, **Django** or **Streamlit**.
2. Manage their sessions, memory and knowlege in a database.
3. Monitor, evaluate and improve their performance.

Phidata not only makes building Agents easy but also provides pre-built templates for agentic systems that you can deploy to your own AWS account. Here's how they work:

- Create your codebase using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your application locally: `phi ws up`
- Run your application on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

<Note>
We strongly believe that the data used by Agents should be stored securely inside your VPC.

We fully support BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) and encourage you to use your own AWS account.

## Agent App

Let's build an `agent-app` which includes a Streamlit UI, FastApi server and Postgres database for memory and knowledge. Run it locally using docker or deploy to production on AWS.
