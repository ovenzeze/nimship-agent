title: Reasoning
---

Reasoning is an **experimental feature** that enables an `Agent` to think through a problem step-by-step before jumping into a response. The Agent works through different ideas, validating and correcting as needed. Once it reaches a final answer, it will validate and provide a response. Let's give it a try. Create a file `reasoning_agent.py`

```python reasoning_agent.py
from phi.agent import Agent
from phi.model.openai import OpenAIChat

task = (
    "Three missionaries and three cannibals need to cross a river. "
    "They have a boat that can carry up to two people at a time. "
    "If, at any time, the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either side of the river, the cannibals will eat the missionaries. "
    "How can all six people get across the river safely? Provide a step-by-step solution and show the solutions as an ascii diagram"
)

reasoning_agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"), reasoning=True, markdown=True, structured_outputs=True)
reasoning_agent.print_response(task, stream=True, show_full_reasoning=True)
```

Run the Reasoning Agent:

```bash
pip install -U phidata openai

export OPENAI_API_KEY=***

python reasoning_agent.py
```

<Warning>

Reasoning is currently limited to OpenAI models and will break about 20% of the time. **It is not a replacement for o1.**

It is an experiment fueled by curiosity, combining COT and tool use. Set your expectations very low for this initial release. For example: It will not be able to count ‘r’s in ‘strawberry’.
</Warning>

## How to use reasoning

To add reasoning, set `reasoning=True`. When using reasoning with tools, do not use `structured_outputs=True` as gpt-4o cannot use tools with structured outputs.

```python
reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-2024-08-06"),
    reasoning=True,
    markdown=True,
    structured_outputs=True,
)
reasoning_agent.print_response("How many 'r' are in the word 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'?", stream=True, show_full_reasoning=True)
```

## Reasoning with tools

You can also use tools with a reasoning agent, but do not use `structured_outputs=True` as gpt-4o cannot use tools with structured outputs. Lets create a finance agent that can reason.

<Warning>

Reasoning with tools is currently limited to OpenAI models and will break about 20% of the time.

</Warning>

```python finance_reasoning.py
from phi.agent import Agent
from phi.model.openai import OpenAIChat
from phi.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True)],
    instructions=["Use tables to show data"],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
    reasoning=True,
)
reasoning_agent.print_response("Write a report comparing NVDA to TSLA", stream=True, show_full_reasoning=True)
```

Run the script to see the output.

```bash
pip install -U phidata openai yfinance

export OPENAI_API_KEY=***

python finance_reasoning.py
```

    "results, conclusions, and any potential biases or flaws:\n\n"
    "Abstract: This study examines the effect of a new teaching method on student performance in mathematics. "
    "A sample of 30 students was selected from a single school and taught using the new method over one semester. "
    "The results showed a 15% increase in test scores compared to the previous semester. "
    "The study concludes that the new teaching method is effective in improving mathematical performance among high school students."

    "five people tied on the track. You can divert the train onto another track, but there is one person tied there. "
    "Do you divert the train, sacrificing one to save five? Provide a well-reasoned answer considering utilitarian "
    "and deontological ethical frameworks. "
    "Provide your answer also as an ascii art diagram."
