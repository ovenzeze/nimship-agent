Junior DE is an AI App for data analysts, engineers and scientists to offload the daily, mundane data tasks. It can:

- Write python scripts for processing data, creating charts
- Analyze CSV, Parquet or JSON data using DuckDb.
- Write complex queries including joins and filtering.
- Run data transformations and export the results.
- Explain analysis step-by-step.

The best part is that it inspects, validates and runs code like a regular engineer. It also plays well with long-term, multi-turn conversations. **Follow along to build your own Junior DE.**

## Create your codebase

Create your codebase using the `junior-de` template

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
phi ws create -t junior-de -n junior-de
```

```bash Windows
phi ws create -t junior-de -n junior-de
```

</CodeGroup>

This will create a folder `junior-de` with the following structure:

```bash
junior-de                     # root directory for your junior-de
├── ai                      # directory for AI components
    ├── duckgpt             # directory for the DuckDb DE
    ├── pygpt               # directory for the Python DE
    ├── agents          # AI agents
    ├── knowledge_base.py   # agent knowledge base
    └── storage.py          # agent storage
├── app                     # directory for Streamlit apps
├── db                      # directory for database components
├── notebooks               # directory for Jupyter notebooks
├── Dockerfile              # Dockerfile for the application
├── pyproject.toml          # python project definition
├── requirements.txt        # python dependencies managed by pyproject.toml
├── scripts                 # directory for helper scripts
├── utils                   # directory for utilities
└── workspace               # phidata workspace directory
    ├── dev_resources.py    # dev resources running locally
    ├── prd_resources.py    # production resources running on AWS
    ├── jupyter             # jupyter notebook resources
    ├── secrets             # directory for storing secrets
    └── settings.py         # phidata workspace settings
```

## Run Junior DE locally

Start your Junior DE using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
phi ws up
```

```bash shorthand
phi ws up dev:docker
```

</CodeGroup>

**Press Enter** to confirm and give a few minutes for the image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the docker dashboard.

## DuckGPT: Automate Data Analysis using DuckDb

- Open [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) to access your Junior DE.
- Your first Junior DE is **DuckGPT** that can write and run SQL queries using DuckDb.
- Click on **DuckGPT** and enter a username.
- Message "Show me revenue over time"
- See your Junior DE work through the problem.
- Message "Save it" to save the query to the `ai/duckgpt/scratch` folder.

## Add your data

`DuckGPT` tables are defined in the `ai/duckgpt/knowledge/tables.json` file.

- You can add `csv`, `json` or `parquet` files stored locally or on s3.
- You can also add `txt` files to provide more information to the Agent.
- Click the `Update Knowledge Base` to load the knowledge base.

<Note>

<Snippet file="message-us-discord.mdx" />

</Note>

## How DuckGPT works

DuckGPT uses the `DuckDbAgent` defined in the `ai/duckgpt/duckgpt.py` file. You can customize your agent and adapt the Junior DE to your workflow.

## PyGPT: Automate Data Analysis using Python

- Your next Junior DE is **PyGPT** that can write python scripts for processing data, create charts and more. Click on **PyGPT**.
- Message "Show me a chart of revenue per year"
- Each script that PyGPT creates and runs is saved to the `ai/pygpt/scratch` folder for reference
- See your Junior DE work through the problem.

## Add your data

`PyGPT` files are defined in the `ai/pygpt/knowledge/files.json` file.

- You can add `csv`, `json` or `parquet` files stored locally or on s3.
- You can also add `txt` files to provide more information to the Agent.
- Click the `Update Knowledge Base` to load the knowledge base.

## How PyGPT works

PyGPT uses the `PythonAgent` defined in the `ai/pygpt/pygpt_streamlit.py` file. You can customize your agent and adapt the Junior DE to your workflow.

## Optional: Run Jupyterlab

A jupyter notebook is a must have for AI development and your `junior-de` comes with a notebook pre-installed with the required dependencies. To start your notebook:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Jupyter">
    Update the `workspace/settings.py` file and set `dev_jupyter_enabled=True`

    ```python workspace/settings.py
    ...
    ws_settings = WorkspaceSettings(
        ...
        # Uncomment the following line
        dev_jupyter_enabled=True,
    ...
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Jupyter">

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash terminal
    phi ws up --group jupyter
    ```

    ```bash shorthand
    phi ws up dev:docker:jupyter
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    **Press Enter** to confirm and give a few minutes for the image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the docker dashboard.

  </Step>
  <Step title="View JupyterLab UI">
    - Open [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to view the Jupyterlab UI. Password: **admin**
    - Open `notebooks/duckgpt` to play with DuckGPT.
