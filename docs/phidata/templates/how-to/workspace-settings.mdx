title: Workspace Settings
---

The `WorkspaceSettings` object in the `workspace/settings.py` file defines common settings used by your apps and resources. Here are the settings we recommend updating:

```python workspace/settings.py
ws_settings = WorkspaceSettings(
    # Update this to your project name
    ws_name="ai",
    # Add your AWS subnets
    subnet_ids=["subnet-xyz", "subnet-xyz"],
    # Add your image repository
    image_repo="[ACCOUNT_ID].dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
    # Set to True to build images locally
    build_images=True,
    # Set to True to push images after building
    push_images=True,
)
```

<Note>

`WorkspaceSettings` can also be updated using environment variables or the `.env` file.

Checkout the `example.env` file for an example.

### Workspace Name

The `ws_name` is used to name your apps and resources. Change it to your project or team name, for example:

- `ws_name="booking-ai"`
- `ws_name="reddit-ai"`
- `ws_name="vantage-ai"`

The `ws_name` is used to name:

- The image for your application
- Apps like db, streamlit app and fastapi server
- Resources like buckets, secrets and loadbalancers

Checkout the `workspace/dev_resources.py` and `workspace/prd_resources.py` file to see how its used.

## Image Repository

The `image_repo` defines the repo for your image.

- If using dockerhub it would be something like `phidata`.
- If using ECR it would be something like `[ACCOUNT_ID].dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

Checkout the `dev_image` in `workspace/dev_resources.py` and `prd_image` in `workspace/prd_resources.py` to see how its used.

## Build Images

Setting `build_images=True` will build images locally when running `phi ws up dev:docker` or `phi ws up prd:docker`.

Checkout the `dev_image` in `workspace/dev_resources.py` and `prd_image` in `workspace/prd_resources.py` to see how its used.

## Push Images

Setting `push_images=True` will push images after building when running `phi ws up dev:docker` or `phi ws up prd:docker`.

Checkout the `dev_image` in `workspace/dev_resources.py` and `prd_image` in `workspace/prd_resources.py` to see how its used.

- [Building your production image](/templates/how-to/production-app#build-your-production-image)

## AWS Settings

The `aws_region` and `subnet_ids` provide values used for creating production resources. Checkout the `workspace/prd_resources.py` file to see how its used.
