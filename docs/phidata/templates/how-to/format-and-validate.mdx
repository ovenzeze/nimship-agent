title: Format & Validate
description:

## Format

Formatting the codebase using a set standard saves us time and mental energy. Phidata templates are pre-configured with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) that you can run using a helper script or directly.

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
./scripts/format.sh
```

```bash ruff
ruff format .
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validate

Linting and Type Checking add an extra layer of protection to the codebase. We highly recommending running the validate script before pushing any changes.

Phidata templates are pre-configured with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) and [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) that you can run using a helper script or directly. Checkout the `pyproject.toml` file for the configuration.

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
./scripts/validate.sh
```

```bash ruff
ruff check .
```

```bash mypy
mypy .
```

</CodeGroup>
