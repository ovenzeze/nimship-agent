[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is an exceptional choice for building a full-stack Web App in 2024. It stands apart from typical hype cycles and is known for its maturity and stability. Combined with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) it truly is one of our favourite frameworks.

The `django-app` template gives you a full-stack Web App built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
