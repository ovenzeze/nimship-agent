title: Docker
---

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) is a game-changing technology that enables us to run applications locally. We package our [Apps](templates/apps/introduction) into **Containers** that include everything needed to run the application

## Docker Resources

Phidata enables us to define docker resources as pydantic objects so we can build our application layer purely in python. In most cases you will not be creating the **Docker Resources** directly, instead we'll use [Apps](templates/apps/introduction) to create the resources for us.

<Accordion title="difference from docker-compose">

Docker Compose is more mature and defines resources as a "yaml configuration" whereas phidata allows us to define resources as "python objects".

We still love docker-compose, just want to elevate the experience. With phidata we rarely define the resources directly, instead we use Apps to create the resources for us.

### Benefits

- Define containers and images as pydantic objects with input and type validation.
- Allows re-use and testing of resources.
- Import them in software layer like regular python objects.
- Package multiple resources into [Apps](templates/apps/introduction) so we can define **"Applications as Code"**.
- Enable AI features that interact with the resource from python code.

## Container

The `DockerContainer` class defines a container, for example use the following code to define a container running the [whoami](https://github.com/traefik/whoami) image. Start it using `phi start resources.py`

```python resources.py
from phi.docker.resource.container import DockerContainer

whoami = DockerContainer(
    name='whoami',
    image='traefik/whoami',
    ports={'80': 80},
)
```

Test it by opening [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) or using:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:80
```

The same can be defined as an `App`:

```python resources.py
from phi.docker.app.whoami import Whoami

whoami = Whoami()
```

Stop resources using `phi stop resources.py`

## Image

The `DockerImage` class defines an image, for example use the following code create your own python image and run it in a container. Build it using `phi start resources.py`

<CodeGroup>

```python resources.py
from phi.docker.resource.container import DockerContainer
from phi.docker.resource.image import DockerImage

python_image = DockerImage(
    name="my/python",
    tag="3.11",
    path=".",
    # push_image=True,
)

python_container = DockerContainer(
    name='python',
    image=python_image.get_image_str(),
)
```

```docker Dockerfile
FROM phidata/python:3.11.5

CMD ["chill"]
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>

Make sure to add the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.
