## Enhanced Agent Visibility, RAG Improvements, and Workflow Tools
This update introduces exciting new features, performance enhancements, and crucial fixes to ensure better usability and functionality.

### Highlights

- **Multimodal Agents**: Agents now natively support image and audio with video coming soon.
- **Agentic Workflows are now generally available**: Build deterministic multi-agent pipelines using Workflows.
- **Agent can share state between tool calls**: New session_state variable allows Agents to maintain and share state across function calls.
- **Agents in teams can respond directly to the user**: now responses of team members do not need to go through the team leader.
- **Context Injection**: Agents can be provided context that is resolved in real-time during execution.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Tool calls can now be confirmed (or approved) before being executed.
- **Advanced chunking**: Support for Semantic and Agentic chunking (and more).

### New Features

- **Show Reasoning in the Playground**: Provides users with insights into the agent's thought process and decision-making, offering a behind-the-scenes look at how the agent operates within the Playground.
- **Show Tool Call in the Playground**: Display tool call results and metrics on hover within the Playground.
- **Sessions Page Enhancements**: Added context, reasoning, and tools integration to the Sessions page.
- **Delete Custom Endpoint for Playground**: Introduced the ability to delete endpoints directly within the Playground.
- **Show References in the Playground**: You can now view the sources used for RAG.
- **Chunking Strategies in RAG**: Introduced five levels of chunking strategies in RAG: Semantic Chunking, Fixed Chunking, Agentic Chunking, Document Chunking, and Recursive Chunking.
- **Unified Reranker for Vector Databases**: Implemented a unified reranking feature across various vector databases, including LanceDB, with support for CohereReranker.
- **Milvus Vector Database Integration**: Added support for Milvus as a vector database option.
- **Support for Multi-Modalities**: Added support for processing audio, video, and image data to enhance agent capabilities.
- **Context Injection**: Improved context handling to enhance agent responses and usability.
- **Pre-hook and post-hook for function calls**: enabling users to validate arguments, add human-in-the-loop flows and validate results of tool calls.

### Improvements

- **Duplicate Endpoint Prevention**: Enhanced endpoint creation logic to prevent duplicates.
- **Workflow Session Logging**: Improved logging mechanisms for workflow sessions.
- **Ollama Tool Call Streaming**: Updated the Ollama tool to improve call streaming capabilities.
- **Logging Updates for Gemini**: Enhanced logging functionality for Gemini models.
- **Ollama LLM Class Updates**: Resolved issues in tool calling to improve usage reliability.
- **Product Manager Agent Workflow Example**: Added a new example to demonstrate the practical use and capabilities of workflow.
- **Dynamic Prompt**: System prompt, user prompt and instructions can now be passed as functions resolved during run-time.

### Bug Fixes

- **Session Read-All Fix**: Fixed an issue where titles were not created when users provided a list of messages instead of a single message.
- **Ollama Tool Response Issue**: Addressed inconsistencies where Ollama tools always returned empty responses.

### Breaking Changes

- **`Agent.add_context` is now `Agent.add_references`** as the context terminology is now used for context injection. Similarly, `context_format` is now `references_format`.
