Many providers like Together, Groq, Sambanova, etc support the OpenAI API format. Use the `OpenAILike` model to access them by replacing the `base_url`.

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from os import getenv
from phi.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from phi.model.openai.like import OpenAILike

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAILike(
        id="mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1",
        api_key=getenv("TOGETHER_API_KEY"),
        base_url="https://api.together.xyz/v1",
    )
)

# Get the response in a variable
# run: RunResponse = agent.run("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")
# print(run.content)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")
```
