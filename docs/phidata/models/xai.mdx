xAI is a platform for providing endpoints for Large Language models.

## Authentication

Set your `XAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get one [from xAI here](https://console.x.ai/).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export XAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```

```bash Windows
setx XAI_API_KEY sk-***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `xAI` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py

from phi.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from phi.model.xai import xAI

agent = Agent(
    model=xAI(id="grok-beta"),
    markdown=True
)

# Get the response in a variable
# run: RunResponse = agent.run("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")
# print(run.content)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")

```

</CodeGroup>
