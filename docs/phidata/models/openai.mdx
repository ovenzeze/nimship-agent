The GPT models are the best in class LLMs and used as the default LLM by **Agents**.

## Authentication

Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get one [from OpenAI here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```

```bash Windows
setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `OpenAIChat` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py

from phi.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from phi.model.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    markdown=True
)

# Get the response in a variable
# run: RunResponse = agent.run("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")
# print(run.content)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")

```

</CodeGroup>
